  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The web service structure has been modeled in order to exploit modularity as much as possible through the usage of JAX-RS subresource locators.
  Starting from the root resource, <i>NfvResource</i>, all subresource handlers are created at runtime through the <i>@Path</i> annotation on methods.
  Except for the root, no other classes have the <i>@Path</i> annotation at class level, this implies that subresources won't be automatically created by the Jersey runtime, 
  but they will have to be instanced by the parent classes, allowing easy reorganization of the resource tree. This characteristic goes together with the HATEOAS model
  of the service: both data and URLs of the resources are created in a singleton class, (<i>NfvDeployer</i>), shared between resources. In this way, resources do not know
  their location, yet they provide access and methods to interact with the service, and deal with service exceptions mapping them to their corresponding <i>WebApplicationException</i>.
  
  
  <h2>NfvDeployer</h2>
  <p>The <i>NfvDeployer</i> class is the component in charge of storing data about the NFV and performing the operations requested by the web interface;
  it's instanced in a lazy fashion using the static method <i>getInstance</i>, receiving the base URL from the first resource instantiating it; after initialization, it's shared between all resources invoking the same method with no parameters. 
  Defines path constants in order to relief the resource classes from managing hard coded URIs, 
  making them configurable by modifying a single class. 
  <p>The class holds all data structures and references to the external Neo4jSimpleXML service, and provides methods to create the basic components of the NFV, accessed both at initialization time and through the REST endpoints.
  Provides concurrency management making these basic methods <i>synchronized</i>, and since more methods can access at the same time to the same data structures, avoids data races 
  using <i>ConcurrentHashMap</i>s to store objects.
  To save references to node ids provided by the Neo4jSimpleXML storage engine, two Maps have been defined for storing <i>Node</i>s and <i>Host</i>s: the first mapping the name to the id, 
  the second mapping the id to the object reference. In this way, two accesses are required to retrieve a class instance given its name, although the presence of the name in the IDs table
  grants the effective presence of the object both in memory and in persistent storage.
  
  <h2>Resource classes</h2>
  <p>The root resource class, <i>NfvResource</i>, is defined as a <i>@Singleton</i>, in order to give instructions to the runtime to build this class only once.
  This allows the root resource to read the NFV information in its constructor method, making sure that it won't be invoked again.
  After reading all system information, the constructor loads it through the NfvDeployer methods, and then provides access to three subresources, <i>Hosts</i>, <i>Nffgs</i> and <i>Catalog</i>,
  also instantiated as a singleton.
  <p>Subresources are stateless, they only contain references to the methods that can be invoked by the REST interface, and references to children entities.
  Each operation invokes one or at most two methods of the NfvDeployer, leaving the business logic as much as possible outside the resource class.
  It's part of the resources tasks to catch deployer's exceptins and translate them into HTTP status codes understandable from a REST point of view. On the other hand, NfvDeployer tries to define
  methods that can only throw checked exceptions, in order to reduce the amount of <i>Internal Server Error</i>s thrown by the servlet container.
  <p>The resources are in charge of running some basic checks on the input data: the most important is to check that the NF-FG is deployed,
  through a method offered by NfvDeployer. This allows the service to not restrict creation of nodes and links at the deployer method level, 
  allowing usage of the same methods (<i>createNode</i>,<i>createLink</i>) for multiple tasks, to initialize the first NF-FG, to deploy a new graph, 
  and to create those entities from the REST interface.
  
  <h2>Providers</h2>
  <p>In order to customize the user experience and provide validation against the XML schema two classes annotated with <i>@Provider</i> are defined:
  <i>ExceptionLogger</i> and <i>NfvMessageBodyReader</i>.
  <p>The first takes care of intercepting the exceptions thrown by the application and handling them differently than the container would have. Specifically, if the exception is a server side exception (having
  a status code above 500) it just provides logging through the application logger; if the exception is a client side exception, belonging to the 4xx class, it provides a plain text error body, instead of 
  the standard html page from tomcat, this way it's possible to introduce custom messages giving useful information about the error and how it can be corrected.
  <p>The latter class, <i>NfvMessageBodyReader</i>, provides schema validation by using a custom unmarshaller bound to the XML schema. In case of validation error, a <i>400 Bad Request</i> response is sent back to the client.
